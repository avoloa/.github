# Volos by ABR
_Volos_ is the nickname given to the development team headed by Voloa [(@voloa on GitHub)](https://github.com/voloa), however, this project is owned and operated by ABR (also known as ABBR United). Most of what the project does is not public due to security and privacy issues however there will hopefully be some public repositories related to outdated, retired, or obsolite data created by _Volos_. ABR estimates that ~0.5% of the projects code and resorces will be Open Source from 2027 onwards, prior to that, contributions here will be mainly public documentation and updates related to platforms overseen by the project.
